## [news.rr.nihalnavath.com/](https://news.rr.nihalnavath.com/)
I prefer this one less, due to the domain. It just creates a slashtag off the creation domain.

# Trick Someone With Your Rickroll
This is really just a measure of how clever they are.
## Destector Bots
Rickroll detetors that aren't scams are out there. I use this one: [rickrolldetectorbot.herokuapp.com](https://rickrolldetectorbot.herokuapp.com/)<br>
There is also a Discord one. I haven't yet tested it, however: [discord.bots.gg/bots/735590162938986506](https://discord.bots.gg/bots/735590162938986506)<br>
There are also Chrome Extensions.
Avoiding the official music videos or related is a good idea to trick these. One of my Hidden on YouTube section might work.
## Link Shorteners
LINK SHORTENERS ARE A STUPID PLAN IF YOU ARE GOING FOR SOMEONE SMART.<br>
Both is.gd (adding a dash to the end) and Bitly (adding a plus) will show you what the link goes to.
## secretrickroll.com
I don't really have anything to say. Really nice the way you can customize it.<br>
On managed devices (work/school), this site may not work.
